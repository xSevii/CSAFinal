AP CSA - 6/9/25 

Description/Instructions: 
This app is created in Android Studio and has 3 screens. This program demonstrates various examples of how lists can be manipulated and sorted. On the first screen, you can add your own set of numbers to a list, then sort them from least to greatest. On the second screen, you put in a number to find and a random list is generated. It will tell you if the number you requested was found in the list or not. The third screen will congratulate you on making it to the end.
